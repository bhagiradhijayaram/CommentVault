# 🛡️ Comment Vault

**Comment Vault** is a responsive and interactive React-based application that displays a list of user comments with rich features like:

✅ Search  
✅ Sorting (Post ID, Name, Email)  
✅ Pagination  
✅ Filter & state persistence across page refreshes

This app fetches data from a public API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments`) and ensures that the user's interactions (search, sort, page, page size) are preserved even after reloading the page using `localStorage`.

- 🔃 Sort by Post ID, Name, or Email (asc/desc toggle)
- 📄 Pagination with dynamic page size
- 💾 Persisted filters, sort state, and pagination via `localStorage`
- 📱 Fully responsive UI (mobile-first)
- ✅ Clean codebase using functional components and hooks
